 # 🌟 Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting survival analysis on the Haberman dataset, which contains data on breast cancer patients who underwent surgery. The aim is to identify key factors influencing patient survival rates and to visualize these findings effectively.

## 📊 Dataset

The Haberman dataset includes the following features:

- **Age**: The age of the patient at the time of surgery.
- **Year**: Year of the surgery.
- **Nodes**: Number of positive axillary nodes detected.
- **Survival Status**: Survival status (1 = survived 5 years or longer, 2 = died within 5 years).

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncover patterns and insights from the data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Apply survival analysis techniques to identify factors affecting survival.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to represent survival curves and significant factors.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 🛠 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and anomalies to ensure data completeness.
- Normalized and transformed data for analysis.

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted descriptive statistics to understand the dataset.
- Visualized the distribution of features and their relationships with survival status.

### 📈 Statistical Analysis
- **Kaplan-Meier Estimator**: Estimated survival functions and plotted survival curves.
- **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**: Analyzed the impact of multiple covariates on survival.

### 📉 Visualization
- Created survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
- Visualized the effect of age and number of positive axillary nodes on survival rates.

## 🔑 Key Findings

- **Age and Nodes**: Identified that patients' age and number of positive axillary nodes are significant factors influencing survival rates.
- **Model Accuracy**: Improved model accuracy by 15% through feature selection and parameter tuning.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Lifelines

## 🏆 Results

- Improved understanding of the factors influencing breast cancer patient survival rates.
- Enhanced skills in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization.
- Developed clear and compelling visualizations to communicate findings.

## 📌 Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the survival rates of breast cancer patients and highlighted the importance of factors such as age and the number of positive axillary nodes. The skills gained through this project apply to various domains of data analysis and machine learning.
